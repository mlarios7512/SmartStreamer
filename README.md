Looking for shows to watch but not sure what streaming platforms have them? Looking to binge several shows but not sure how much time and money it'll take? We've got you covered.

## Features
* Search for any TV series. Results for a TV show include:
	* Release date, popularity, number of seasons, age rating, and more.
	* A list of streaming platform that the shows available.
		* 8 total platforms supported: Apple, Disney+, HBO, Hulu, Netflix, Paramount, Peacock, and Prime (video).
* Track shows using multiple watchlists. Each watchlist can be used with the site's calculator that estimates subscription time & cost needed to binge the entire watchlist.



## Demo of site

* Note: The video shows only features for a logged in user. The "visitor" page (the link that is visible at the start but not demoed in the video) does not allow for the creation of multiple watchlists (just one that can't be saved) and it does not display watchtime estimates for each season in the results.
